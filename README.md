# KatalonAutomationDemoWeb

#### This project is test automation of a C# MVC 5 website and C# Web API using Katalon.

# Katalon Info:
###### Katalon supports Keyword-Driven testing
###### Katalon supports Behavior-Driven (Cucumber) (BDD) testing
###### Script with Groovy and Java
###### Uses Selenium, WinAppDriver, and Appium
###### Build a Test Case with Keywords
###### Build a Test Suite with Test Cases
###### Build a Test Suite Collection with Test Suites
###### Parallel execution of test cases in a test suite
###### Execute tests with Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge
###### Headless testing is available in Chrome and Firefox
###### Reporting is available in an HTML format and an CSV (Excel) format

# Analysis:
###### Katalon does a good job of bridging the gap between software automation engineer and manual tester with the Keyword-Driven testing. However, the industry standard Page-Object Model is a better software engineering solution to automation.
###### The Page-Object Model could be used in your Katalon project, but you would be working around the functionality that Katalon provides.
###### Katalon requires a license and is not the best software engineering solution for automation.
###### Out of the box, I recommend Katalon for teams where manual testers need to be able to automate Web, Desktop, and Mobile applications where image recognition is not required.
###### However, image recognition could be added in a custom Keyword with OpenCV and Java if an experienced software engineer is on the team.
###### The better automation solution is Cucumber (or SpecFlow), Selenium, and custom automation frameworks built with the Page-Object Model.
